Hi! Welcome to my little project.

What's the point?
I'll start with a confession: I train pole dance. It's very demanding sport, with a lot to learn and master. I attend a class once a week, and have my own training twice a week. Sometimes I get lost in all the figures I need to train, and what is the best solution for that? Yeah, self written programme to do it for me.

Ultimately, my goal it to create a training database - with figures, combos and information on how well I can do them and last time I practised them. Based on that, the plan for next training is made.

This is the first version - working on console. Next step is writting GUI and then, maybe, making a web app out of that. 

For now, what is included:
- distinguishing between users. for new user - creating his own file with progress, for recurring user - downloading previous data;
- adding new figures;
- brownsing already added figures;
- writing changes to file.

TODO in nearest future:
- name the figures so they can be included;
- change class Figure so it contains date and level;
- randomization of figures to train;
- keeping log of trainings;
- fix existing code if needed.

I'll keep working. Stay tuned!
